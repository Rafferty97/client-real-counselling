          <h2>Hello, my name is Annette</h2>
          <p>and I’m offering Email Counselling known as E-Counselling.</p>
          <h3>E-Counselling</h3>
          <p>E-Counselling is very exciting because university reports are showing that it is proving to be as good as, and at times even more successful than traditional face-to-face counselling. The ‘paper trail’ is largely responsible for this success. Clients can use the printed word to re-read and focus on what was presented to them throughout the counselling session. This is an advantage because many people feel anxious particularly at the first counselling session and they can easily forget important points.</p>
      <h3>Advantages of E-Counselling</h3>
      <ul><li><strong>Convenience</strong> &mdash; In today’s busy world E-Counselling is becoming very popular because it’s so convenient. You can have counselling in your lunch hour or anywhere that you have Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li><strong>Autonomy</strong> &mdash; The autonomous person can be even more self-governing and independent as you can choose when you are not bound to rigid appointment times and face to face communications.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> &mdash; Many people are house bound either because of illness, disability or because they have young children. E-Counselling is proving to be such a help for these clients because the client does not have to leave their home.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymity</strong> &mdash; Some people feel more relaxed without the ‘face to face’ communication of a traditional counselling session. This is an excellent way of getting support if you are a terribly shy person or a war veteran for instance. E-Counselling is far less confrontational!</li></ul>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I obtained my Diploma in Perth at The Australian Institute of Professional Counsellors in October 2003, then volunteered for a year and finally opened my own small business where I counselled on a ‘face to face’ basis from my home.</p>
      <p>I bring life experience, compassion and dedication to help you on your journey through the ups and downs of life. I have had personal experience in trauma therefore when I tell you that I understand how you feel ... I mean it.</p>
      <h3>Child Abuse</h3>
      <p>Child Abuse is all too common and it is a heavy burden to carry.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately I’ve had personal experience with this. It can take away your childhood joy. I promise you that we can go a long way to change our thought processes and feelings regarding child abuse.</p>
      <p>Fortunately I have worked through my issues and have gained power over them so I am now happily in a position to help others.</p>
      <p>To help you we need three things:</p>
      <ol><li>Your willingness.</li>
      <li>My support.</li>
      <li>Helping Techniques</li>

    <h3>Depression</h3>
      <p>Depression is an awful state to find one’s self in but I truly believe that sedatives are not always the answer. While they can give us temporary relief sedatives cannot solve our problems, and besides all medications have side effects. It is like throwing a blanket over our problems. What we really need is to get to the root cause of the problem. I know this is not always easy to achieve and some pain may be involved but sedatives cannot offer us the amazing sense of pride and ultimate strength which comes with the facing of our issues and fears. We live in a world of ‘quick fixes’ today and this can lead us to run and hide from anything painful.</p>

      <h3>Free Counselling for War Veterans</h3>
      <p>Our war veterans are in trouble! Too many are somehow falling through the ‘net’ of our mental health system and some are even committing suicide on an alarming scale.</p>
      <p>With this in mind I am offering FREE COUNSELLING and SUPPORT to war veterans.</p>
      <p>E-Counselling may be invaluable for ex-soldiers who may want support but not want the confrontation of traditional ‘face to face’ counselling. Anonymity is a distinct advantage and confidentiality is assured.</p>
      <p>This is my small way of saying thank you for all that you have sacrificed to keep Australians free!</p>
      <p>Sometimes we all need help.</p>
      <p>It is not our ‘issues’ which undo us, as much as our ‘attitude’ towards our issues.</p>
      <p>Email or ring me today.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Annette</p>
      <ol class="br-above"><li>The first session is <strong>free</strong>.</li>
      <li>Sliding scale for payment.</li>
      <li>I'm not rigid with your time.</li>
