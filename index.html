          <h2>Hello, my name is Annette.</h2>
          <p>I'm offering email counselling, known as e-counselling.</p>
          <p>
            E-counselling is very exciting because university reports are showing
            that it is proving to be as good as, and at times even more successful
            than traditional face-to-face counselling.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advantages of e-counselling are convenience for busy people,
            autonomy, the paper trail for referencing the session and mobility.
          </p>
          <p>
            I obtained my Diploma in Professional Counselling in October 2003,
            then volunteered for a year and finally opened my own small business
            where I counselled on a face-to-face basis from my home.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring life experience, compassion and dedication to help you on
            your journey through the ups and downs of life.
            I have had personal experience in trauma therefore when I tell you
            that I understand how you feel... I mean it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depression is an awful state to find one's self in but I truly
            believe that sedatives are not the answer.
            While they can give us temporary relief sedatives cannot solve our
            problems, and besides all medications can have side effects.
            What we really need is to get to the root cause of the problem.
            I know this is not always easy to achieve and some pain may be
            involved but sedatives cannot offer us the amazing sense of pride
            and ultimate strength which comes with the facing of our issues.
            We live in a world which these days runs and hides from anything
            painful - and worse than that is there are 'quick fixes' readily
            handed out for just about every ailment known to man.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not our 'issues' which undo us... as much as our 'attitude'
            towards our issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life has always been a series of good and bad times.
            It is to our advantage if we want to be mentally healthy...
            to deal with issues as they arise.
          </p>
